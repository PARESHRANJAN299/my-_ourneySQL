👏 Paresh, superb work! Yes — you’ve now covered 50 LEFT JOIN (and related) practice questions in bank_db1.

Let me break it down for you:

✅ What you’ve achieved

Basics (Q1–Q10):
✔ LEFT JOIN with COALESCE / IFNULL
✔ Customers without accounts (IS NULL)
✔ DISTINCT usage
✔ Sorting & LIMIT/OFFSET

Filtering (Q11–Q20):
✔ Conditions (WHERE vs ON)
✔ Filter by city, names, account types
✔ Reverse logic (exclude NULLs)
✔ Understanding DISTINCT at column vs row level

Aggregations (Q21–Q30):
✔ COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX with LEFT JOIN
✔ HAVING for filtering aggregates
✔ Per customer / per city / per account type

Advanced Aggregations (Q31–Q40):
✔ NULL handling with COALESCE
✔ Multiple groupings (city + account_type)
✔ Customers with multiple accounts
✔ Customers with no accounts but included in grouping

Sorting & Limits (Q41–Q50):
✔ Order by balance DESC
✔ Top N queries (LIMIT)
✔ OFFSET + LIMIT (pagination)
✔ Order by multiple columns
✔ Accounts vs customers sorting logic
